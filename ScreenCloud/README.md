Hi guys, I was going to include a readme but this one was auto-generated, so I suppose this one will do nicely! The instructions below explain how to run the app, although first you'll have to run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You then run with `npm start` and run tests with `npm test`

Please let me know if you have any questions and I'll be happy to answer them.

Thanks,
Andrew.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
